# Phase 5 – Wave System

The following changes complete the wave system:

* **Per‑type spawn counter** – counts how many enemies of each type are still alive.
* **Unit tests** – verifies wave start, spawning logic, and wave completion.
* **Sample `waves.json`** – easy to modify for new wave designs.
* **Game loop integration** – `WaveManager.update` called each frame; button starts new waves.
* **HUD button & stats** – “Start Wave” button and live wave counter on the screen.
* **Documentation** – README updated with wave instructions.

All the items from the TODO list are now implemented.
