# Phase 5 – Wave System

The current codebase now supports a fully‑functional wave system.  **Key features**:

- Wave definition in `data/waves.json`.
- Dynamic spawning with per‑type counters.
- Wave start/stop hooks.
- UI hooks for "Start Wave" button and wave stats.
- Jest unit tests for `WaveManager`.
- Documentation in `README.md`.

The repo is ready for the next sprint: **Wave UI** and **Upgrade System**.
